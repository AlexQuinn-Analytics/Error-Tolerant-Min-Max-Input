# Error-Tolerant-Min-Max-Input
# Find Min and Max

This Python program interactively prompts the user to enter integer numbers. It continues to collect input until the user enters the word "done". Once "done" is entered, the program calculates and prints the largest and smallest numbers from the provided input. The program also includes error handling to manage non-integer inputs.

## Features

* **Interactive Input:** Prompts the user to enter numbers repeatedly.
* **Sentinel Value:** Uses "done" as a sentinel value to signal the end of input.
* **Error Handling:** Employs `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle non-integer input, providing an informative message to the user.
* **Min/Max Calculation:** Calculates and displays the largest and smallest numbers entered.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.

### How to Run the Program

1.  Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `min_max.py`).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Execute the script using the command: `python min_max.py`
